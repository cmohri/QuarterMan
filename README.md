# Overview

For our final project, our group decided to try to create a version of the Bert Bell Schedule fit for the modern era. We will add new features like customizable templates for different potential schedules, patch bugs in the Bert Bell Schedule, and most importantly we will keep the simplicity and usefulness that has ingrained it into our Stuyvesant society.
